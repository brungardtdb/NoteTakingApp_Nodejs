This application was my introduction to node.js. This was a part of a node.js
bootcamp on Udemy. This is also a bit of an introduction to Javascript for me.
This application is just a simple command line application that allows you to
use commands to add and remove notes to a JSON file, you can also list the note
titles and read a note by providing the title.

Here is the URL for the Udemy course on node.js:
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/

I look forward to learning more about node.js and actually developing some
web applications using node.js!
